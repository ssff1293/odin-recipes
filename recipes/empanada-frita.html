    <h2>Argentine "Empanadas" recipe</h2>
    <p>
        An empanada is a thin bread dough, shortcrust pastry or puff pastry filled with a salty or sweet preparation and baked or fried. The filling can include red or white meat, cheese, fish, vegetables or fruit. The dough is generally made from wheat flour –although corn flour or other cereals can also be used– and usually contains some fat, oil or butter. Empanadas are a traditional dish of most cuisines in Spanish-speaking countries, such as Spain and Latin America.

    <h2>MILANESA NAPOLITANA RECICPE</h2>
    <p>
        Milanesa a la Neapolitana, although it has an Italian name, is a dish originally from the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina, and consists of meat, usually beef, covered in Milanese tomato sauce, ham and cheese. The meat is prepared in a very simple way, first it is battered so that it is crispy, and then it is cooked in the oven so that the cheese melts. Undoubtedly, there is an incredible contrast of textures that will please both adults and children. Although beef is the most common to make this recipe, the truth is that the Neapolitan Milanese can also be made with other meats, such as chicken, loin... It is also possible to modify the ingredients that we put on top to present different dishes each time. time, since the interesting thing about this dish is the technique that combines the batter with the coating and the final cooking in the oven. In any case, it will be a very juicy and delicious meat.

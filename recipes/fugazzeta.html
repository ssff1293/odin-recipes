    <h2>FUGAZZETA RECIPE</h2>
    <p>
        The fugazzeta is a pizza prepared with two layers and the cheese is placed between them, so as to form a stuffed pizza. It comes in two varieties depending on the ingredients that are placed on the top layer, cheese and onion, or onion alone. Traditionally, the lower lid is thicker and larger, and the upper one is thinner and smaller, so that the latter is crunchy. The cheese used for the filling is cuartirolo, but in some cases mozzarella is used. For the cover, provolone or Parmesan cheese is used.
    </p>
    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>600g of pizza dough</li>
        <li>200g grated mozzarella</li>
        <li>50g brie cheese – “cuartirolo”</li>
        <li>half red onion</li>
        <li>half sweet onion</li>
        <li>half sweet onione</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Aceite de oliva virgen extra</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>ELABORATION STEP BY STEP</h3>
    <p>
        Now we start with the preparation of the pizza, assuming that we already have the dough for the Argentine pizza prepared and also the onion ready with any of the two methods that I have just described.

        <li>We stretch the dough on a tray that we will have put a little oil on, and let it rise a little. In my case I also added a little oil to the dough so that it could spread better. Initially it should take between 30 minutes or an hour, depending on the temperature of your kitchen, the temperature of the dough, etc.</li>
        <li>Once we have the dough ready, we put all the mozzarella cheese [muzzarella] on top and the brie cheese [cuartirolo], always leaving a free edge around the pizza so that later we can put the layer of dough on top and have a surface to that it sticks Once we have the cheese, we can add a touch of black pepper on top if we want.</li>
        <li>Now, very carefully, we extend the pizza dough that we will have reserved to make the layer until we get a very thin dough, and we put it on top. To help us, we stick it on one side and then on the opposite end, then we do the same with the other ends, as if it were a square, and finally we stick the dough to all the edges of the pizza. It would have to look almost like a Galician empanada, only that the upper layer is much thinner.</li>
        <li>Por último ponemos la cebolla que habremos reservado por encima de la pizza y metemos en el horno a 250ºC durante algo más de tiempo de lo normal. Creo que en esta ocasión estuvo unos 8-9 minutos, aunque los tiempos dependen mucho del tipo de horno que tengas. Si queremos podemos ponerle un poco de parmesano y un chorrito de aceite de oliva virgen extra por encima de la pizza antes de meterla en el horno.</li>
        <li>We will know that the pizza is ready when the onion has begun to burn / toast in some parts. Once ready we take it out and, in my case, I put a little wild oregano that I have that gives it a very powerful smell when eating. I leave you with some photos of the final result so you can see how the pizza turned out.</li>
    </ol>
